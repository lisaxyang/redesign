          This project is an exercise in implementing the elements of good design
          I have learned thus far. A public website was chosen from a small local 
          business to be redesigned. This website was examined in regards usability, 
          responsiveness, and accessibility.
          Afterwards, I underwent a process of prototyping my intended design 
          to demonstrate areas I think could be improved and how to improve them.
          A semi-functional final website was produced as the final product.

      <div class="section row">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <div class="p">
          Furthermore, there are multiple accessibility concerns that result
          from examinig this website.
          <br><br>
          The WebAIM WAVE tool revealed that there are missing page titles
          and headers, along with unclear page regions, 
          which make the website difficult to navigate.
          There is also no language preset, which allows webpages to load
          faster and helps search engines properly categorize it.
          The text is also quite small and many areas of text contrast 
          poorly with the background color, which greatly hinder readability.
          <br><br>
          After using a screenreader on this website, I noticed that many 
          things do not have descriptors and make it difficult to navigate.
          For example, the contact information (address and phone number) 
          are written without descriptors, so it is difficult to know both
          that the screenreader is beginning to read an address and to tell 
          where the end of the zip code and the beginning of the phone number is.
          There are also asterisks in random places to denote emphasis on 
          a seemingly arbitrary set of items, and there is no alternative 
          texts for images.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="note row">
        <div class="pnote">
          Note: I also found it a bit humorous that the "We" in the upperleft
          image is actually text and not a glitch in the image, which 
          the screenreader revealed while reading the page.
          This would undoubtedly lead to even more confusion!

          While designing my website, the goal was to both address the 
          issues listed above and also make the website responsive.
          Therefore, I created 3 versions of each prototype to model: 
          desktop screens, tablet screens, and mobile phone screens.
          <br>
          Below, I have shown my prototypes with annotations to

        <div class="comment">
          Comment: I found that while I was prototyping and creating the 
          style guide, that my style choices were fluid and continued to change.
          This is also evident in my final product.
          <br>
          For example, I alternated between putting the photo menu on the 
          right side of the screen versus putting it at the bottom of 
          the screen for tablet mode.
          <br>
          I found prototyping very helpful in giving me the space to think through
          multiple versions of the design, so that when I was actually building 
          the website I had backup plans in case the Plan Adid not 
          turn out as expected.

      <div class="section row">
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <div class="p">
          Like I mentioned earlier, there were some changes made to my 
          final design while I was implementing it.
          <br><br>
          First of all, I chose to have a dropdown button for the directory 
          instead of putting it inside the navbar. I did this because it 
          allowed me the flexibility of displaying it only on certain 
          screen sizes, and so that in the navbar users could still click 
          on menu and be directed to the menu page, instead of only being 
          able to navigate there through the dropdown menu.
          <br><br>
          I also chose to have the photo menu be below the main menu in the iPad 
          screen, as shown by my tablet low-fi design, because when I was 
          actually designing the website, it felt a bit cluttered with the 
          photos on the right column. This was especially true if the 
          font size was increased.
          <br><br>
          Finally, I have a sticky-left side navigation bar, which moves with 
          you after you scroll down the page. Originally, I only implemented
          the sticky-left feature. However, when examining the page with 
          a larger font, the navigation bar did not fit the screen. 
          Therefore, I researched and implemented a feature to allow the 
          navigation bar to move to the top of the screen when you scroll down 
          far enough, allowing it to be fully visible on screens with increased font size.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section row">
        <h2>Accessibility Analysis</h2>
        <div class="p">
          One of the goals in redesigning this webpaage was also to make it
          more accessible. Therefore, I conducted similar tests as I did with 
          the original webpage to check its accessibility.
          <br><br>
          Using the WebAIM WAVE test, I found that there were no errors, while 
          before there were many errors in multiple categories. The test 
          did give me a warning about the redundancy of my buttons in the 
          photo menu to say "Click", but after some deliberation, I decided 
          to keep this description because there were not that many 
          buttons on the page, on the desktop site this would be the first button 
          you encounter, and I personally am not familiar with many similar 
          interfaces and would appreciate the increased learnability of the button.
          <br><br>
          I also conducted tests with increased font sizes and changing the 
          page language using Google Translate. As a result, I chose to enhance
          the style of my side navigation bar to accomodate screens with 
          increased font sizes (as mentioned before) and made sure that any 
          overflow text as a result was still readable and understandable.
          When the page was translated in a different language, the structure 
          and hierarchy of the categories were still clear enough that 
          I felt I could navigate it reasonably well. I noticed the menu 
          directory played a large rol in this also, along with the horizontal 
          line markers
          <br><br>
          When I tested my website with a screenreader, I was actually surprised
          to find the screenreader much more helpful. At first, when I had 
          used the screenreader for the original website, I thought the 
          screenreader was simply confusing because it would read random 
          sections of text, such as only "de gallo" in a description that 
          contained "pico de gallo". However, when I used the screenreader on 
          my website, I found that it read the website in logical chunks, 
          likely separated by my div markers. For example, it now read the 
          entire description of ingredients, instead of just "de gallo", and 
          also read the prices associated with each size together.
          The design of this website therefore not only increases visual 
          readability, but its structure also enhances readability for 
          screenreaders
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="Content container-fluid" id="Conclusion">
      <div class="section row">
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="p">
          I had a really fun time working on a redesign for a public website. 
          I think I was able to learn a lot from prototyping and from 
          creating a style guide. Along the way, I noticed that each  
          step was instrumental in preparing me for the next part.
          I noticed sometimes though, that I would spend a long time 
          deliberating margins and padding, and I also can understand how editing
          small design things can really pull you in and steal focus.
          This is something I hope to work on in the future.
          I was also able to have a lot more practice with flexbox 
          when creating a responsive site, and I worked with JavaScript 
          and jquery to resolve my side navigation bar issue when the 
          font sized increased.
