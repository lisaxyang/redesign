          This project is an exercise in implementing the elements of good design
          I have learned thus far. A public website was chosen from a small local 
          business to be redesigned. This website was examined in regards usability, 
          responsiveness, and accessibility.
          Afterwards, I underwent a process of prototyping my intended design 
          to demonstrate areas I think could be improved and how to improve them.
          A semi-functional final website was produced as the final product.

          I hope you enjoy reading it; a lot of love was put into this piece. &#128522;

          I chose the menu page of Bagel Gourmet Cafe, a small restaurant in 
          Providence Rhode Island, that truly does sell tasty bagels.
          Below, I have attached a screenshot from the webpage.

          Below is a brief summary of design problems I discovered from interacting
          with the website:

      <div class="section row">
        <div class="probsection col">
          <h3>Usability</h3>
          <ul class="problems">
            <li>Lots of distracting elements</li>
            <li>Color contrast hinders readability</li>
            <li>Unclear structuring/hierarchy of items and categories</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="probsection col">
          <h3>Learnability</h3>
          <ul class="problems">
            <li>Unclear that "shopping cart" means make an order</li>
            <li>Unclear when something is a link and when it is not 
              - use of blue hyperlink color and underline for non-link texts also</li>
            <li>Confusing logic behind font sizes and color for different
              categories (food items, options, add-ons)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section row">
        <div class="probsection col">
          <h3>Memorability</h3>
          <ul class="problems">
            <li>No directory 
              - forces you to memorize order of menu categories and items</li>
            <li>Lack of order in format forces you to memorize/re-learn 
              format of where prices are found for each item
            </li>
            <li>No reasonable order of the categories on the menu 
              - salads are next to hamburgers and 
              beverages are between sandwiches and mexican food</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="probsection col">
          <h3>Efficiency</h3>
          <ul class="problems">
            <li>Extremely long page that fails to utilize horizontal space
              in order to allow for more efficient scanning
            </li>
            <li>Only method to move around page is to scroll 
              - no opportunity to increase efficiency in navigation</li>
            <li>Prices not aligned so reading speed is hindered</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section row">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <div class="p">
          Furthermore, there are multiple accessibility concerns that result
          from examinig this website.
          <br><br>
          The WebAIM WAVE tool revealed that there are missing page titles
          and headers, along with unclear page regions, 
          which make the website difficult to navigate.
          There is also no language preset, which allows webpages to load
          faster and helps search engines properly categorize it.
          The text is also quite small and many areas of text contrast 
          poorly with the background color, which greatly hinder readability.
          <br><br>
          After using a screenreader on this website, I noticed that many 
          things do not have descriptors and make it difficult to navigate.
          For example, the contact information (address and phone number) 
          are written without descriptors, so it is difficult to know both
          that the screenreader is beginning to read an address and to tell 
          where the end of the zip code and the beginning of the phone number is.
          There are also asterisks in random places to denote emphasis on 
          a seemingly arbitrary set of items, and there is no alternative 
          texts for images.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <div class="p">
        I also found it a bit humorous that the "We" in the upperleft
        image is actually text and not a glitch in the image, which 
        the screenreader revealed while reading the page.
        This would undoubtedly lead to even more confusion!
